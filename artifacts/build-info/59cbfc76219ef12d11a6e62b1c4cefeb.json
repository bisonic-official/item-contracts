This address can then be used for verification purposes.\n The `ecrecover` EVM opcode allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:\n this function rejects them by requiring the `s` value to be in the lower\n half order, and the `v` value to be either 27 or 28.\n IMPORTANT: `hash` _must_ be the result of a hash operation for the\n verification to be secure: it is possible to craft signatures that\n recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure\n this is by receiving a hash of the original message (which may otherwise\n be too long), and then calling {toEthSignedMessageHash} on it."},"id":1986,"implemented":true,"kind":"function","modifiers":[],"name":"recover","nameLocation":"3670:7:10","nodeType":"FunctionDefinition","parameters":{"id":1965,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":1962,"mutability":"mutable","name":"hash","nameLocation":"3686:4:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1986,"src":"3678:12:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":1961,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3678:7:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"},{"constant":false,"id":1964,"mutability":"mutable","name":"signature","nameLocation":"3705:9:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1986,"src":"3692:22:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"memory","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_memory_ptr","typeString":"bytes"},"typeName":{"id":1963,"name":"bytes","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3692:5:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes_storage_ptr","typeString":"bytes"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"3677:38:10"},"returnParameters":{"id":1968,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":1967,"mutability":"mutable","name":"","nameLocation":"-1:-1:-1","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":1986,"src":"3739:7:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"},"typeName":{"id":1966,"name":"address","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"3739:7:10","stateMutability":"nonpayable","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_address","typeString":"address"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"src":"3738:9:10"},"scope":2220,"src":"3661:227:10","stateMutability":"pure","virtual":false,"visibility":"internal"},{"body":{"id":2032,"nodeType":"Block","src":"4275:203:10","statements":[{"assignments":[2002],"declarations":[{"constant":false,"id":2002,"mutability":"mutable","name":"s","nameLocation":"4293:1:10","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2032,"src":"4285:9:10","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"typeName":{"id":2001,"name":"bytes32","nodeType":"ElementaryTypeName","src":"4285:7:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"visibility":"internal"}],"id":2009,"initialValue":{"commonType":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"},"id":2008,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":false,"lValueRequested":false,"leftExpression":{"id":2003,"name":"vs","nodeType":"Identifier","overloadedDeclarations":[],"referencedDeclaration":1993,"src":"4297:2:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_bytes32","typeString":"bytes32"}},"nodeType":"BinaryOperation","operator":"&","rightExpression":{"arguments":[{"hexValue":"307837666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666","id":2006,"isConstant":false,"isLValue":false,"isPure":true,"kind":"number","lValueRequested":false,"nodeType":"Literal","src":"4310:66:10","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_rational_57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819967_by_1","typeString":"int_const
